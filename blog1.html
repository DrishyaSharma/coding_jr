            <h1>Graphic Tees: Making a Statement</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Casual Day Out:</b> Graphic tees are the go-to choice for casual outings. Pair a striking graphic tee with slim-fit jeans and a fresh pair of sneakers for a laid-back yet stylish ensemble. For an added layer of cool, throw on a denim jacket. This outfit is perfect for a day spent with friends, grabbing coffee, or exploring the city.</li>
                <li><b>Music Festivals and Concerts:</b> When it comes to music festivals or concerts, graphic tees help you stand out and express your personality. Choose a tee with a vibrant design or your favorite band’s logo. Combine it with distressed jeans or shorts and combat boots. Complete the festival look with a beanie or snapback, some wristbands, and a hint of attitude.</li>
                <li><b>Street Style:</b> Embrace the street style trend by pairing an oversized t-shirt for men with joggers or cargo pants. High-top sneakers and a bucket hat will tie the look together, giving you an effortlessly cool and urban vibe. This outfit is not only comfortable but also a testament to your fashion-forward sense.</li>
                <li><b>Night Out:</b> Believe it or not, graphic tees can work for a night out. Opt for a dark, sophisticated design and pair it with a leather jacket, black jeans, and Chelsea boots. This combination strikes the perfect balance between casual and edgy, making it suitable for hitting bars, clubs, or even a casual dinner date.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>Choosing the Right Fit</h1>
            <p>Rayshi offers a variety of fits to suit your style preferences and occasions:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><b>Oversized Fit:</b> Perfect for street style or relaxed casual looks.</li>
                <li><b>Polo Tees:</b> Great for smart casual occasions, providing a polished yet comfortable option.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Plain Tees: Timeless Versatility</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Smart Casual:</b> They are incredibly versatile and can easily be dressed up for a smart casual look. Pair a well-fitted plain tee with chinos and loafers, then add a blazer for an extra touch of class. This outfit is perfect for date nights, semi-formal gatherings, or casual office environments.</li>
                <li><b>Summer Casual:</b> During the warmer months, a plain tee becomes a staple. Pair it with shorts and flip-flops for a relaxed beach-ready look. Don’t forget to accessorize with sunglasses and a hat to stay stylish and protected from the sun.</li>
                <li><b>Athleisure:</b> Plain-shirts are a must-have for athleisure outfits. Wear a plain tee with joggers and your favorite athletic shoes. This look is perfect for running errands, hitting the gym, or casual meet-ups. It’s all about combining comfort with style.</li>
                <li><b>Layering:</b> Plain tees are fantastic for layering, providing a clean and simple base for various outfits. Wear a plain white tee under an open flannel shirt or a lightweight sweater. Pair this with jeans and casual shoes for an effortlessly cool look that works in multiple settings, from casual work environments to weekend adventures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>Final Tips</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Accessories Matter:</b> Enhance your look with the right accessories. Watches, hats, and belts can add a personal touch and elevate your outfit.</li>
                <li><b>Color Coordination:</b> Pay attention to color coordination. Neutral plain tees can be paired with almost anything, while graphic tees should remain the focal point of your outfit.</li>
                <li><b>Occasion Appropriateness:</b> Always consider the occasion. While graphic tees are great for casual settings, plain tees offer more versatility and can be dressed up or down as needed.</li>
            </ol>
