            <h1><b>GRAPHIC TEES: MAKING A STATEMENT</b></h1>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Casual Day Out:</b> Graphic tees are the go-to choice for casual outings. Pair a striking graphic tee with slim-fit jeans and a fresh pair of sneakers for a laid-back yet stylish ensemble. For an added layer of cool, throw on a denim jacket. This outfit is perfect for a day spent with friends, grabbing coffee, or exploring the city.</li><br>
                <li><b>Music Festivals and Concerts:</b>When it comes to music festivals or concerts, graphic tees help you stand out and express your personality. Choose a tee with a vibrant design or your favourite band’s logo. Combine it with distressed jeans or shorts and combat boots. Complete the festival look with a beanie or snapback, some wristbands, and a hint of attitude.</li><br>
                <li><b>Street Style:</b>Embrace the street style trend by pairing an oversized t-shirt for men with joggers or cargo pants. High-top sneakers and a bucket hat will tie the look together, giving you an effortlessly cool and urban vibe. This outfit is not only comfortable but also a testament to your fashion-forward sense.</li><br>
                <li><b>Night Out:</b>Believe it or not, graphic tees can work for a night out. Opt for a dark, sophisticated design and pair it with a leather jacket, black jeans, and Chelsea boots. This combination strikes the perfect balance between casual and edgy, making it suitable for hitting bars, clubs, or even a casual dinner date.</li>
            </ol>
