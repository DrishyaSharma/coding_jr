                <li><b>Oversized Jeans:</b>Similar to baggy jeans but with an exaggerated fit, oversized jeans make a bold fashion statement. They are trendy and ideal for those who enjoy a streetwear-inspired look.</li><br>
                <li><b>Bootcut Jeans:</b>EFitted through the thigh and flaring out slightly from the knee to the ankle, bootcut jeans are versatile and can be worn with a variety of footwear, especially boots.</li><br>
                <li><b>Straight Fit Jeans: </b>These jeans have a consistent width from the hip to the hem, offering a classic and timeless look. They are neither too tight nor too loose, making them a staple in any wardrobe.
